        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Greetings! My name is Matthew Russell, I am currently a student at the University of South Carolina.</br> 
            I'm currently studying an Applied Computer Science Major with a concentration in Cyber Security. </br>
            Some of my favorite hobbies include playing video games, watching The Office, writing code, and build computers. </br>
            Whenever I'm not hunched over a computer I like to go outside to go fishing or hunting, depending on the time of year.</br>
            I have always been fascinated by technology ever since I was young and it is because of this fascination at a young age </br>
            that has lead me to pursue a career path in the Computer Science field.</br>
